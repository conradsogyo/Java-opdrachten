The program should add numbers 0 to n, where n is a numeral input from user.
It should add the first two terms to get the third term. Fourth term would be second + third term.
When n is 5, program should calculate 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 8 = 13.

So it should each time add the new value to the last one. */
