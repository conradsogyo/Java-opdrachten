/* Computer takes a randomnumber between 1 and 100.
Playuer has to guess the number. When the number is higher than guess, computer says higher.
When it is lower, computer says lower. 
Maximum amount of guesses is 7.

First computer should calculate a randomnumber, secret. 
Then number of lives should be put to 7.

Ten a for loop should start. At the begin of the forloop program should ask for input.
If player guess is higher or lower than secret, computer should have output 'lower' or 'higher'.
Lives should be -1.

For loop should continue untill Lives = 0 or if guess is equal to secret. 

For loop:  for (guess = 7, guess > 0, guess-- ){
	input user;
	if (player == secret){
	you guessed the number! It was + secret
	break;
	} if else (player < secret){
	the number is higher. Guess again
	} if else (player > secret){
	the number is lower. Guess again}
	
If for loops ends, guesses are finised.
Output: sorry, you did not guess the number!
